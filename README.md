# Seven-Seals-of-Event
It is my first project that I have done. This website is for Chinese company called Seven Seals of Event, which provides wedding planning, exhibitions, travels and many other activities which they can organize for any special day. It was a fantastic opportunity to gain a lot of experience and overcome the following challenges while developing this website:


 •	Website design and fully responsive layout;
 
 •	PHP code implementation for making and validating Contact Us form;
 
 •	Making Home page anchor link to open a specific class in Wedding/Activity page;
 
 •	Solved problems to stop inefficiencies in the website’s parallax scroll animation;
 
 •	Making weddings and Activity page option section  more accessible.
